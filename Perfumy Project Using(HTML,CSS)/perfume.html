            The first About Us page design example belongs to a construction company for live events sets. It focuses on the clients and the experiences they would get had they chosen the company’s services. The About Us page is short and simple in terms of copy, however, it offers interactive visuals such as parallaxes. As an important element, we need to mention the statistics section that explains the company’s ethics and results.
            While the barbershop aims to bring the gap between timeless interior design and traditional craftsmanship, the website follows this strong gimmick. With clean code and very atmospheric visuals, the About Us page allows you not only to meet the team behind the project but feel the retro Barbery culture in all its glory.This website represents a nursery with holistic childcare for the modern world. The About Us page tells a story and explains the concept of providing children with the tools to care for their own mental and physical health. You can also read about each member of the childcare, their experience, and credentials.
            Here we have a fun and playful experience all about a card game where you can choose your cards, shuffle and play or buy a physical deck. The About Us page offers a museum-style experience that explains the history of the game and the rules, with a fitting horizontal scrolling experience.

            <p>The word perfume is used today to describe scented mixtures and is derived from the Latin word per fumus (lit. 'through smoke'). The word perfumery refers to the art of making perfumes. Perfume was refined by the Romans, the Persians and the Arabs. Although perfume and perfumery also existed in East Asia, much of its fragrances were incense based. The basic ingredients and methods of making perfumes are described by Pliny the Elder in his Naturalis Historia.
                To date, the oldest perfumery was discovered on the island of Cyprus.[5] Excavations in 2004-2005 under the initiative of an Italian archaeological team unearthed evidence of an enormous factory that existed 4,000 years ago during the Bronze Age.[6] This covered an estimated surface area of over 0.4 hectares (0.99 acres) indicating that perfume manufacturing was on an industrial scale.
